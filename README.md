# Step 1: Spot 5 Mistakes
Here's what we found wrong in the original CV:

## No spacing between sections (e.g., “Professional ExperienceProject Manager”) | Reduces readability, looks unprofessional |

## Vague bullet points (e.g., “Managed various projects successfully”) | Doesn’t show specific achievements or impact |

## Inconsistent date formats | “2020 - Current” vs. “May 2018 to Dec 2019” – inconsistent style |

## Unclear language proficiency | “French” is listed, but no level (basic? fluent?) |

## LinkedIn link not clickable or properly formatted | Not user-friendly; lacks full URL or hyperlink formatting |

# Step 2: How to Fix Each One

No spacing or headings | Add line breaks and format clearly:<br>Professional Experience<br>Project Manager |

Vague bullet points | Change: “Managed various projects successfully” → “Led 5+ cross-departmental projects, increasing efficiency by 15%” |

Inconsistent dates | Use consistent format throughout, e.g., “Jan 2020 – Present” |

Languages unclear | “French” → “French – Intermediate” or “Basic working proficiency” |

LinkedIn formatting | Format as a clickable full link: linkedin.com/in/johndoe |
